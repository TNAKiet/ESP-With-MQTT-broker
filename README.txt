This project about ESP8266 acts as a node, it communicate with STm32f407 through UART and Arduino Uno through Zigbee.
- STM32F407 read a temperature and huminity sensor and send it to esp8266 for publishing to MQTTbroker, and it can be control some orther device
 - Arduino Uno connect with some devices and those devices can be controlable.

Website have its backend using Python3 and Front-end using html,css and javascript .
